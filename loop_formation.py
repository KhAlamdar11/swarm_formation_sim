# loop formation simulation of swarm robots, form a triangle, and build loop by merging

# comments for programming purpose:
# Similar status design with the second line formation:
    # '0': free, wondering around, available to form a pair, a triangle or joint a group
    # '1': transit status between '0' and '2', robot in a group, but not a loop yet
        # '1_0': forming status, either in a pair, or in a triangle formation
            # '1_0_0': forming status, in a pair
            # '1_0_1': forming status, in a triangle
        # '1_1': merging status, joining a robot '2' group
    # '2': formal members of a loop formation group
    # '-1': free, wondering around, ignoring all interactions
# Only allowed status transitions are:
    # forward: '-1'->'0', '0'->'1_0_0', '0'->'1_0_1', '0'->'1_1', '1_0_0'->'1_0_1'
    #          '1_0_1'->'2', '1_1'->2
    # backward: '1'->'-1', '2'->'-1'
# Status transition regarding robot '1':
    # When 2 '0' meets, they both become '1_0_0', and start adjust distance to the loop
    # space. When distance is good, they don't perform any status transition yet. Only
    # when a new '0' comes over, it will trigger all three robots into '1_0_1' status.
    # And during the entire time of '1_0_0', the two robots are always welcoming new '0',
    # even their distance is not good yet. When in '1_0_1', after the three robots form
    # the perfect triangle and good loop space, they will trigger a status transition
    # of becoming '2'.
# Two-stage forming explanation:
    # It's likely to happen that a '0' meets two '0' at the same time, especially at the
    # the begining of the simulation. It would be conveniently to form a triangle directly
    # if this happens. But I stick with two stage forming, to have a pair before the triangle.
    # Mainly because it makes programming simplier, and it takes another loop to turn the
    # pair to a triangle. And also in real robots, the pair will be established before the
    # triangle.

# There is no index indicating where the robot is on the loop, that means each robot's
# role is equal. Each has two neighbors, one on left, one on right. There is no start or
# end on the loop.

# A simple loop adjusting method was used. Each robot keeps moving to achieve the desired
# loop space. In the meantime, if a robot on the loop meets another robot on the same loop
# that is not one of its key neighbors, it moves away from that robot, using the old velocity
# for the loop space destination.
